# React Day 2019
In 2019, I ran a training session about React. This repository was used during the presentation to get some key ideas across. This repository doesn't contain much, and what it does contain became outdated pretty fast with the adoption of Hooks.

It's meant to be educational though, so feel free to use this for anything if you feel like it can help you!
